v0 New Wave: Acquired info from https://ytdl-org.github.io/youtube-dl/index.html & https://buildmedia.readthedocs.org/media/pdf/kivy/latest/kivy.pdf
        This mini project will help both content & general users to either create or to download content either in gif, mp4, or mp3
        format. 60% of the other project is completed currently in progress on making it enabled for an .exe format for quicker
        use, with some other goodies in stored. This is version .01

        In the next few updates versions will make an setup.py for quicker editing on the backend. This project will continue on for a while
        and will help aid with other custom projects that are in stored for future releases.

        If you have any suggestions feel free to DM me Ill be more than happy to hear your thoughts!

--v1 Version_Info Added: Just added the version_info, will include my custom comments onto the program as well have 3 sets at the moment. As stated
                            on v0 will include a setup.py and other goodies to help assist in reading the backend code.
